# SignShop



# The most important informations

SignShop allows you to set up physical shops by punching a chest with your items you want to sell, then punching a sign (while holding redstone dust). It's easy to set up, and even easier to customize!



# Commands and permissions

There are a few basic SignShop permission nodes. The “*” symbol indicates either the name of a sign or a type of block (depending on the permission node). The permission will then affect that sign or type of block. This also works for custom signs. SignShop permission nodes are case insensitive.

Signshop.DenyUse.* (Note: Signshop.Signs.* overrides this permission node)
This permission denies usage of signs.
Example: You may wish to deny a group's ability to sell to an infinite shop (i.e. an [iSell] sign), in which case you would give them: Signshop.DenyUse.iSell
Signshop.DenyLink.* (Note: OP overrides this permission node)
This permission denies the linking of shops to certain in-game blocks (Chest, Sign, Lever, Dispenser, Furnace, Brewingstand, Enchantmenttable, Slab).
Example: You may wish to deny a group's ability to link their shops to a furnace to prevent automatic smelting, in which case you would give them: Signshop.DenyLink.Furnace
Signshop.Signs.*
This permission allows players to create signs.
Example: You might want to disallow a group from creating signs to modify redstone levers, you can remove that ability by negating them with the following permission nodes (assuming your permission plugin allows negating permissions):
-Signshop.Signs.Device
-Signshop.Signs.DeviceOn
-Signshop.Signs.DeviceOff
-Signshop.Signs.Toggle
Signshop.CopyPaste
This permission allows players to click on signs with black dye to copy information onto an already active SignShop.
Example: If you want to update the price of an item, create a new sign and put the new price on the bottom line, leave the other 3 lines blank, and click with black dye. You can modify the description, the price, and the type of sign this way. Blank lines are ignored. You cannot, however, change a Device sign to a Buy sign, as the operations are incompatible with one another. You can also allow moderators and admins to edit other player's signs with Signshop.CopyPaste.Others
Signshop.Permit
If the "AllowPermits" setting in the global options is set to true, players must have this node in order for their shops to work.
Example: You can use SignShop and a permission plugin to sell permits allowing users to be merchants. Without a permit, the shop will be disabled and they will need to buy another in order for their shops to continue functioning. You can also do Signshop.Permit.Stone to only allow shops containing the material “Stone”. Material names can be found at http:jd.bukkit.org/rb/apidocs/org/bukkit/Material.html (Make sure to replace any spaces with an underscore, i.e. “BAKED POTATO” becomes “BAKED_POTATO”)
Signshop.ChangeOwner
This permission allows a player to click on another player with redstone to change the owner of a SignShop.
Example: If you would like to set up a player account as a bank, or transfer a store to another player, you would punch them with redstone, then punch the sign you would like to modify. If you do not own the sign that is being modified, you will also need the permission Signshop.ChangeOwner.Others to do so.
Signshop.Destroy.Others
This permission allows a player to destroy shops that they do not own.

Example: Give this permission to moderators or helpers that you want to be able to clean up abandoned shops but you don't want them to be able to do other SignShop admin duties. 

Signshop.IgnoreMax

This permission bypasses any defined maximum shop settings in the config.
Example: You can make it so normal players can only create something like 10 signs, while donators can create infinite, by giving them Signshop.IgnoreMax
Signshop.IgnoreRepair
This permission bypasses AllowEnchantedRepair setting in the config.
Example: You can make it so "Blacksmiths" can repair enchanted items with Signshop.IgnoreRepair
Signshop.Inspect.Own
Allows you to inspect your own shops by hitting the sign with the inspection material. (Book and Quill by default)
Signshop.Inspect.Others
Allows you to inspect other player's shops by hitting the sign with the inspection material. (Book and Quill by default)
Signshop.Dye.Own
Allows you to use dyes and glow on your shop signs.
Signshop.Dye.Others
Allows you to use dyes and glow on shops that you do not own.
Signshop.BypassShopPlots.*
This permission bypasses EnableShopPlotSupport setting in the config.
Example: You can make it so VIPs are allowed to create shops is regions with the “allow-shop” flag set to “deny” in Worldguard using Signshop.BypassShopPlots.Worldguard
Supported plugins: Worldguard's “allow-shop” flag, Towny's shop plots
Signshop.Admin.*
This permission allows players to create administrative signs (such as shops with infinite items for global shops).
Example: You can use this permission to grant the ability to make signs with the playerIsOp tag (defined in the config). Signshop.Admin.Heal allows a player to create a healing station.
Signshop.SuperAdmin
This permission makes it so players are seen by SignShop as OPs.
